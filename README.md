# Mega App – Second Monitor Sanctuary

This repository contains a Windows-only .NET 8 WPF application designed to give your second monitor a calm, always-interesting dashboard. The experience mixes interactive toys, mindful utilities, and ambient visuals so you can take micro-breaks without diving into distracting websites.

## Feature Highlights
- **Modular layout** – each feature is a standalone user control, so it is easy to rearrange or extend.
- **Pomodoro companion** – a minimalist focus/break timer with progress feedback.
- **Idle Garden** – low-effort clicker to level up a tranquil garden spirit.
- **Affirmation carousel** – rotates curated quotes to keep morale high.
- **Breathing rhythm** – animated orb that guides inhale/exhale pacing.
- **System pulse** – lightweight clock and memory usage glance.
- **Ambient drift** – looping particle field for subtle motion therapy.

Everything runs offline, uses a muted palette, and is optimized to stay out of your way while still keeping the second screen feeling alive.

## Getting Started
1. Open `MegaApp.sln` with Visual Studio 2022 or later on Windows.
2. Ensure the **.NET 8 Desktop Runtime** (or SDK) is installed.
3. Set `MegaApp` as the startup project and press **F5** to build and run.

Feel free to remix modules, swap themes, or add your own widgets. The modular structure keeps future experimentation straightforward.
